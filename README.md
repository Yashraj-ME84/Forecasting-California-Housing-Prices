# Forecasting California Housing Prices

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using various regression techniques. The analysis incorporates key parameters such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

## Objectives
- Analyze California housing prices and identify key determinants affecting price trends.
- Implement various regression techniques to establish correlations between housing prices and selected parameters.
- Present findings through data visualizations to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following key parameters:
- **longitude**: Geographic coordinate indicating the east-west position.
- **latitude**: Geographic coordinate indicating the north-south position.
- **housing_median_age**: Median age of houses in the area.
- **total_rooms**: Total number of rooms in a house.
- **total_bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in a house.
- **population**: Total population of the area.
- **households**: Total number of households in the area.
- **median_income**: Median income of the area.
- **median_house_value**: Median house value (the target variable for prediction).
- **ocean_proximity**: Proximity to the ocean (categorical variable).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and correlations to identify trends.
3. **Regression Techniques**: Implement multiple regression models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression
   - Other applicable regression techniques
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

## Visualizations
Data visualizations are created to illustrate key findings and trends within the housing market.
